  question: >
      can you solve the following riddle? Two turkeys in front of the turkey,
      two turkeys behind the turkey, tell me how many total turkeys?
  answer: >
      There are three turkeys in total. In this riddle, when it mentions "two
      turkeys in front of the turkey” it's referring to the arrangement of
      turkeys in relation to a last turkey and when it mentions "two turkeys
      behind the turkey” it's referring to the arrangement of turkeys in
      relation to the first turkey. So, with the arrangement of a total of three
      turkeys it can satisfy both the conditions.
